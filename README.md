## Usage

Repository contains source code of engine, third-party sources and build tools for composing all this stuff into final platform-specific bundles.  
You may work on your game using shell scripts manually but project hosts own extension for Visual Studio Code for simplify these things.  
Shell scripts targeted for work under Windows 10 within WSL2 and Ubuntu-20.04 as distro.  
Almost all will be work under native Linuxes but some of scripts (like build.sh win32) must be run only from WSL2 shell because runs Windows binaries.  
So main point of all of this that you build your game fully from source, there is no prebuilt binaries, full control over the process.

### Workflow

As described above all what you need to build and package your game in one place for different platforms is WSL2.  
You may do it in separate environments (like build Windows binaries in your IDE, build macOS/iOS binaries on macOS and rest on native Linux distro) but better do it in one place.

Process of creating your game in two words looks like this:
* Once prepare workspace where all intermediate build files will be stored
* Build executables from source to platforms that you needed
* Compile scripts (AngelScript and/or Mono; but Native were compiled with built executables)
* Bake all resources (shaders, images and etc) to special formats that will be loaded super fast by server/client
* Package built executables and baked resources from steps above to final platform specific bundle (zip, msi, app, apk and etc)
* Enjoy your shipped game and iterate development

There are couple of shell scripts that help us to do it:  
* `BuildTools/prepare-workspace.sh` - prepare our workspace to futher work (install linux packages, setup emscripten, download android ndk and etc)
* `BuildTools/build.sh` - build executable for specific platform
* `BuildTools/compile-scripts.sh` - compile scripts from scripting layers
* `BuildTools/bake-resources.sh` - bake game assets (images, shaders, scripts, models and etc) to special intermediate formats
* `BuildTools/make-packages.sh` - finally package server(s) and client(s) for end user
* `BuildTools/validate.sh` and `BuildTools/validate.bat` - that scripts designed for validate that our sources compiling in general; you don't need that scripts and they need for automatic checking of repo consistency and run from ci/cd system like github actions

Scripts can accept additional arguments (`build.sh` for example accept platform for build for) and this information additionaly described in [BuildTools/README.md](https://github.com/cvet/fonline/blob/master/BuildTools/README.md).

### Public API

*Todo: write about versioning SemVer https://semver.org and what public API included to itself*  
Documents related to public API:
* [Public API](https://fonline.ru/PUBLIC_API)
* [Multiplayer Script API](https://fonline.ru/MULTIPLAYER_SCRIPT_API)
* [Singleplayer Script API](https://fonline.ru/SINGLEPLAYER_SCRIPT_API)
* [Mapper Script API](https://fonline.ru/MAPPER_SCRIPT_API)

### Setup

Clone with git this repository.  
Run `./fonline-setup` in the repository root in your PowerShell.  
This script interactively check your system for all requirements and helps to generate new project.  
*Todo: Provide additional info for non Windows 10 users*

#### Windows Subsystem for Linux

Main point of WSL2 for us that we can run Windows programs from Linux.  
That feature allows unify almost all our build scripts into one environment.  
Minimum version of Windows 10 is 2004 build 19041 from May 2020.  
Recommended Linux distro is [Ununtu-20.04](https://ubuntu.com) on which all build scripts tested.  
You may use other distro but there is no guarantee that it will work out of the box.

#### Visual Studio Code

Engine hosts own Visual Studio Code extension for simplify work with engine stuff.  
In editor go to the Extensions tab and then find and install 'FOnline' extension (it's already available in marketplace).  
Extension activates automatically when editor finds any file that contains `fonline` in name of any file at workspace root.  
More about extension usage you can find in [Tutorial](https://fonline.ru/TUTORIAL) document.

#### Package dependencies

Following Linux packages will help us build our game for target platforms.  
These packages will automatically installed during workspace preparing (i.e. `prepare-workspace.sh`).
* Common:  
`clang` `clang-format` `build-essential` `git` `cmake` `python` `wget` `unzip`
* Building for Linux:  
`libc++-dev` `libc++abi-dev` `binutils-dev` `libx11-dev` `freeglut3-dev` `libssl-dev` `libevent-dev` `libxi-dev` `curl`
* Building for Web:  
`nodejs` `default-jre`
* Building for Android:  
`android-sdk` `openjdk-8-jdk` `ant`
* macOS/iOS cross-compilation within OSXCross:  
`patch` `lzma-dev` `libxml2-dev` `llvm-dev` `uuid-dev`

### Footprint

Despite on many third-party libraries that consumed by the whole engine one of the main goal is small final footprint of client/singleplayer output.  
Aim to shift most of things of loading specific image/model/sound/ect file formats at pre publishing steps and later use intermediate binary representation for loading resources in runtime as fast as possible and without additional library dependencies.  
This process in terms of fonline engine called `Bakering`.  
Also as you can see all third-party dependencies linked statically to final executable (except one - proprietary libfbxsdk.dll/so for Baker but the last one is not target for small footprint) and this frees up end user from installing additional runtime to play in your game.
