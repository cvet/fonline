* Editor and Server target platforms
  * Windows
  * Linux
  * macOS *(wip)*
* Client target platforms
  * Windows
  * Linux
  * macOS
  * iOS
  * Android
  * Web
  * PS4 *(wip)*
* Online and singleplayer *(wip)* modes
* Supporting of Fallout 1/2/Tactics, Arcanum and other isometric games asset formats
* Supporting of 3d characters in modern graphic formats
* Hexagonal/square map tiling
* ...write more

## Work in progress

Bugs, performance cases and feature requests see at [Issues page](https://github.com/cvet/fonline/issues/12).

#### Some major issues

* [Multifunctional editor](https://github.com/cvet/fonline/issues/31)
* [C# as scripting language (Mono)](https://github.com/cvet/fonline/issues/37)
* [Singleplayer mode](https://github.com/cvet/fonline/issues/12)
* [Parallelism for server](https://github.com/cvet/fonline/issues/32)
* [Documentation](https://github.com/cvet/fonline/issues/49)

#### Some minor issues

* [Supporting of UDP](https://github.com/cvet/fonline/issues/14)
* [Direct X rendering](https://github.com/cvet/fonline/issues/47)
* [Exclude FBX SDK from dependencies](https://github.com/cvet/fonline/issues/22)
* [Steam integration](https://github.com/cvet/fonline/issues/38)

#### Code refactoring plans

* Exclude singletons
* Preprocessor defines to constants
* Eliminate raw pointers, use only smart
* Hide implementation from headers by pimpl or abstraction
* Fix all warnings from PVS Studio and other static analyzer tools
* Improve more unit tests and gain code coverage to at least 80%

## Repository structure

* *BuildScripts* - scripts for automatical build in command line or any ci/cd system
* *Other* - historical stuff, deprecated and not used
* *Resources* - resources for build applications but not related to code
* *SdkPlaceholder* - all this stuff merged with build output in resulted sdk zip
* *Source* - fonline engine specific code
* *SourceTools* - some tools for formatting code or count it
* *ThirdParty* - external dependencies of engine, included to repository

## Clone / Build / Setup

Before clone make sure that you [install Git LFS](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Installation).\
You can build project by sh/bat script or directly use [CMake](https://cmake.org) generator.\
In any way first you must install CMake version equal or higher then 3.5.

For build just run from repository root one of the following scripts:
* BuildScripts\windows.bat - build Windows binaries (windows only)
* BuildScripts/linux.sh - build Linux binaries (Unix platforms)
* BuildScripts/web.sh - build Web binaries (Unix platforms)
* BuildScripts/android.sh - build Android binaries (Unix platforms)
* BuildScripts/mac.sh - build macOS binaries (macOS only)
* BuildScripts/ios.sh - build iOS binaries (macOS only)

All output binaries you can find in Build/Binaries directory.

Todo:\
...write about build with cmake\
...write about how make final sdk\
...write about how setup own test environment
