.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBmongoc_uri_t\fP provides an abstraction on top of the MongoDB connection URI format. It provides standardized parsing as well as convenience methods for extracting useful information such as replica hosts or authorization information.

See \fI\%Connection String URI Reference\fP on the MongoDB website for more information.

.IP 1. 3
"mongodb" is the specifier of the MongoDB protocol. Use "mongodb+srv" with a single service name in place of "host1" to specify the initial list of servers with an SRV record.
.IP 2. 3
An optional username and password.
.IP 3. 3
The only required part of the uri.  This specifies either a hostname, IPv4 address, IPv6 address enclosed in "[" and "]", or UNIX domain socket.
.IP 4. 3
An optional port number.  Defaults to :27017.
.IP 5. 3
Extra optional hosts and ports.  You would specify multiple hosts, for example, for connections to replica sets.
.IP 6. 3
The name of the database to authenticate if the connection string includes authentication credentials.  If /database is not specified and the connection string includes credentials, defaults to the \(aqadmin\(aq database.
.IP 7. 3
Connection specific options.

The MongoDB C Driver exposes constants for each supported connection option. These constants make it easier to discover connection options, but their string values can be used as well.
.sp
For example, the following calls are equal.

.SH REPLICA SET EXAMPLE
.sp
To describe a connection to a replica set named \(aqtest\(aq with the following mongod hosts:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBdb1.example.com\fP on port \fB27017\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBdb2.example.com\fP on port \fB2500\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
You would use a connection string that resembles the following.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
mongodb://db1.example.com,db2.example.com:2500/?replicaSet=test
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH SRV EXAMPLE
.sp
If you have configured an \fI\%SRV record\fP with a name like "_mongodb._tcp.server.example.com" whose records are a list of one or more MongoDB server hostnames, use a connection string like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
uri = mongoc_uri_new ("mongodb+srv://server.example.com/?replicaSet=rs&appName=applicationName");
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The driver prefixes the service name with "_mongodb._tcp.", then performs a DNS SRV query to resolve the service name to one or more hostnames. If this query succeeds, the driver performs a DNS TXT query on the service name (without the "_mongodb._tcp" prefix) for additional URI options configured as TXT records.
.sp
On Unix, the MongoDB C Driver relies on libresolv to look up SRV and TXT records. If libresolv is unavailable, then using a "mongodb+srv" URI will cause an error. If your libresolv lacks \fBres_nsearch\fP then the driver will fall back to \fBres_search\fP, which is not thread\-safe.
.SH IPV4 AND IPV6
.sp
If connecting to a hostname that has both IPv4 and IPv6 DNS records, the behavior follows \fI\%RFC\-6555\fP\&. A connection to the IPv6 address is attempted first. If IPv6 fails, then a connection is attempted to the IPv4 address. If the connection attempt to IPv6 does not complete within 250ms, then IPv4 is tried in parallel. Whichever succeeds connection first cancels the other. The successful DNS result is cached for 10 minutes.
.sp
As a consequence, attempts to connect to a mongod only listening on IPv4 may be delayed if there are both A (IPv4) and AAAA (IPv6) DNS records associated with the host.
.sp
To avoid a delay, configure hostnames to match the MongoDB configuration. That is, only create an A record if the mongod is only listening on IPv4.

.SH SERVER DISCOVERY, MONITORING, AND SELECTION OPTIONS
.sp
Clients in a \fBmongoc_client_pool_t\fP share a topology scanner that runs on a background thread. The thread wakes every \fBheartbeatFrequencyMS\fP (default 10 seconds) to scan all MongoDB servers in parallel. Whenever an application operation requires a server that is not known\-\-for example, if there is no known primary and your application attempts an insert\-\-the thread rescans all servers every half\-second. In this situation the pooled client waits up to \fBserverSelectionTimeoutMS\fP (default 30 seconds) for the thread to find a server suitable for the operation, then returns an error with domain \fBMONGOC_ERROR_SERVER_SELECTION\fP\&.
.sp
Technically, the total time an operation may wait while a pooled client scans the topology is controlled both by \fBserverSelectionTimeoutMS\fP and \fBconnectTimeoutMS\fP\&. The longest wait occurs if the last scan begins just at the end of the selection timeout, and a slow or down server requires the full connection timeout before the client gives up.
.sp
A non\-pooled client is single\-threaded. Every \fBheartbeatFrequencyMS\fP, it blocks the next application operation while it does a parallel scan. This scan takes as long as needed to check the slowest server: roughly \fBconnectTimeoutMS\fP\&. Therefore the default \fBheartbeatFrequencyMS\fP for single\-threaded clients is greater than for pooled clients: 60 seconds.
.sp
By default, single\-threaded (non\-pooled) clients scan only once when an operation requires a server that is not known. If you attempt an insert and there is no known primary, the client checks all servers once trying to find it, then succeeds or returns an error with domain \fBMONGOC_ERROR_SERVER_SELECTION\fP\&. But if you set \fBserverSelectionTryOnce\fP to "false", the single\-threaded client loops, checking all servers every half\-second, until \fBserverSelectionTimeoutMS\fP\&.
.sp
The total time an operation may wait for a single\-threaded client to scan the topology is determined by \fBconnectTimeoutMS\fP in the try\-once case, or \fBserverSelectionTimeoutMS\fP and \fBconnectTimeoutMS\fP if \fBserverSelectionTryOnce\fP is set "false".
