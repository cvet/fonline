.sp
Returns a description constructed from the initial handshake response to a server.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBmongoc_client_get_handshake_description\fP is distinct from \fBmongoc_client_get_server_description\fP\&. \fBmongoc_client_get_server_description\fP returns a server description constructed from monitoring, which may differ from the server description constructed from the connection handshake.
.sp
\fBmongoc_client_get_handshake_description\fP will attempt to establish a connection to the server if a connection was not already established. It will perform the MongoDB handshake and authentication if required.
.sp
Use this function only for building a language driver that wraps the C Driver. When writing applications in C, higher\-level functions automatically select a suitable server.
.SS Single\-threaded client behavior
.sp
Single\-threaded clients only have one active connection to each server. The one connection is used for both monitoring and application operations. However, the server description returned by \fBmongoc_client_get_handshake_description\fP may still differ from the server description returned by \fBmongoc_client_get_server_description\fP\&. Notably, if connected to a load balanced cluster, the server description returned by \fBmongoc_client_get_server_description\fP will describe the load balancer server (\fBmongoc_server_description_type\fP will return "LoadBalancer"). And the server description returned by \fBmongoc_client_get_handshake_description\fP will describe the backing server.
.SH PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBclient\fP: A \fBmongoc_client_t\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBserver_id\fP: The ID of the server. This can be obtained from the server description of \fBmongoc_client_select_server\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBopts\fP: Unused. Pass \fBNULL\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBerror\fP: An optional location for a \fBbson_error_t\fP or \fBNULL\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.SH RETURNS
.sp
A \fBmongoc_server_description_t\fP that must be freed with \fBmongoc_server_description_destroy\fP\&. If a connection has not been successfully established to a server, returns \fBNULL\fP and \fBerror\fP is filled out.
.SH SEE ALSO
