.Sh SYNOPSIS

.Ft const EC_METHOD *
.Fn EC_GFp_simple_method void

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The elliptic curve library provides a number of different
implementations through a single common interface.
Each implementation is optimised for different scenarios.
An implementation is represented by an
.Vt EC_METHOD
structure.
.Pp
When constructing a curve using
.Xr EC_GROUP_new 3 ,
an implementation method must be provided.
The functions described here all return a const pointer to an
.Sy EC_METHOD
structure that can be passed to
.Xr EC_GROUP_new 3 .
It is important that the correct implementation type for the form
of curve selected is used.
.Pp
For Fp curves the lowest common denominator implementation is the
.Fn EC_GFp_simple_method
implementation.
All other implementations are based on this one.
.Fn EC_GFp_mont_method
adds the use of Montgomery multiplication (see
.Xr BN_mod_mul_montgomery 3 ) .
.Pp
.Fn EC_METHOD_get_field_type
identifies what type of field the
.Vt EC_METHOD
structure supports.
If the field type is Fp, then the value
.Dv NID_X9_62_prime_field
is returned.
If the field type is F2^m, then the value
.Dv NID_X9_62_characteristic_two_field
is returned.
These values are defined in the
.In openssl/objects.h
header file.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
All
.Fn EC_GFp*
functions always return a const pointer to an
.Vt EC_METHOD
structure.
.Pp
.Fn EC_METHOD_get_field_type
returns an integer that identifies the type of field the
.Vt EC_METHOD
structure supports.
