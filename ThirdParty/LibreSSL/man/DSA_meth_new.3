.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Vt DSA_METHOD
structure holds function pinters for custom DSA implementations.
.Pp
.Fn DSA_meth_new
creates a new
.Vt DSA_METHOD
structure.
A copy of the NUL-terminated
.Fa name
is stored in the new
.Vt DSA_METHOD
object.
Any new
.Vt DSA
object constructed from this
.Vt DSA_METHOD
will have the given
.Fa flags
set by default.
.Pp
.Fn DSA_meth_dup
creates a deep copy of
.Fa meth .
This might be useful for creating a new
.Vt DSA_METHOD
based on an existing one, but with some differences.
.Pp
.Fn DSA_meth_free
destroys
.Fa meth
and frees any memory associated with it.
.Pp
.Fn DSA_meth_set_sign
sets the function used for creating a DSA signature.
This function will be called from
.Xr DSA_do_sign 3
and indirectly from
.Xr DSA_sign 3 .
The parameters of
.Fa sign
have the same meaning as for
.Xr DSA_do_sign 3 .
.Pp
.Fn DSA_meth_set_finish
sets an optional function for destroying a
.Vt DSA
object.
Unless
.Fa finish
is
.Dv NULL ,
it will be called from
.Xr DSA_free 3 .
It takes the same argument
and is intended to do DSA implementation specific cleanup.
The memory used by the
.Vt DSA
object itself should not be freed by the
.Fa finish
function.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn DSA_meth_new
and
.Fn DSA_meth_dup
return the newly allocated DSA_METHOD object or NULL on failure.
.Pp
All
.Fn DSA_meth_set_*
functions return 1 on success or 0 on failure.

.Sh HISTORY
These functions first appeared in OpenSSL 1.1.0
and have been available since
.Ox 6.3 .
