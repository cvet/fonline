.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn X509_get0_signature ,
.Fn X509_REQ_get0_signature ,
and
.Fn X509_CRL_get0_signature
set
.Pf * Fa psig
to the signature and
.Pf * Fa palg
to the signature algorithm of
.Fa x ,
.Fa req ,
or
.Fa crl ,
respectively.
.Fn X509_get0_tbs_sigalg
returns the signature algorithm in the signed portion of
.Fa x .
The values returned are internal pointers
that must not be freed by the caller.
.Pp
.Fn X509_get_signature_type
returns the base NID corresponding to the signature algorithm of
.Fa x
just like
.Xr EVP_PKEY_base_id 3
does.
.Pp
.Fn X509_get_signature_nid ,
.Fn X509_REQ_get_signature_nid ,
and
.Fn X509_CRL_get_signature_nid
return the NID corresponding to the signature algorithm of
.Fa x ,
.Fa req ,
or
.Fa crl ,
respectively, just like
.Xr EVP_PKEY_id 3
does.
.Pp
These functions provide lower level access to the signature
for cases where an application wishes to analyse or generate a
signature in a form where
.Xr X509_sign 3
is not appropriate, for example in a non-standard or unsupported format.
