.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn BIO_dump
prints
.Fa len
bytes starting at
.Fa s
to
.Fa bio
in hexadecimal format.
.Pp
The first column of output contains the index, in the byte array starting at
.Fa s ,
of the first byte shown on the respective output line, expressed as a
four-digit hexadecimal number starting at 0000, followed by a dash.
After the dash, sixteen bytes of data are printed as two-digit
hexadecimal numbers, respecting the order in which they appear in
the array
.Fa s .
Another dash is printed after the eighth column.
.Pp
To the right of the hexadecimal representation of the bytes,
the same bytes are printed again, this time as ASCII characters.
Non-printable ASCII characters are replaced with dots.
.Pp
Trailing space characters and NUL bytes are omitted from the main table.
If there are any, an additional line is printed, consisting of the
.Fa len
argument as a four-digit hexadecimal number, a dash, and the fixed string
.Qq <SPACES/NULS> .
.Pp
.Fn BIO_dump_indent
is similar except that
.Fa indent
space characters are prepended to each output line.
If
.Fa indent
is 7 or more, the number of data columns is reduced such that the
total width of the output does not exceed 79 characters per line.
.Pp
.Fn BIO_dump_fp
and
.Fn BIO_dump_indent_fp
are similar except that
.Xr fwrite 3
is used instead of
.Xr BIO_write 3 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On success these functions return the total number of bytes written by
.Xr BIO_write 3
or
.Xr fwrite 3 .
If a failure occurs at any point when writing, these
functions will stop after having potentially written out partial results,
and return -1.
