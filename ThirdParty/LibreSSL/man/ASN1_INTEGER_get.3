.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions convert to and from
.Vt ASN1_INTEGER
and
.Vt ASN1_ENUMERATED
objects.
.Pp
.Fn ASN1_INTEGER_get
converts
.Fa a
to the
.Vt long
type.
.Pp
.Fn ASN1_INTEGER_set
sets the value of
.Fa a
to
.Fa v .
.Pp
.Fn BN_to_ASN1_INTEGER
converts
.Fa bn
to an
.Vt ASN1_INTEGER .
If
.Fa ai
is
.Dv NULL ,
a new
.Vt ASN1_INTEGER
object is returned.
Otherwise, the existing object
.Fa ai
is used instead.
.Pp
.Fn ASN1_INTEGER_to_BN
converts
.Fa ai
into a
.Vt BIGNUM .
If
.Fa bn
is
.Dv NULL ,
a new
.Vt BIGNUM
object is returned.
Otherwise, the existing object
.Fa bn
is used instead.
.Pp
.Fn i2a_ASN1_INTEGER
writes a hexadecimal representation of
.Fa a
to
.Fa out_bio .
The output optionally starts with a minus sign,
followed by an even number of upper case ASCII hexadecimal digits.
After each group of 70 digits, a backslash and a linefeed
are inserted before the next digit.
.Pp
.Fn ASN1_ENUMERATED_get ,
.Fn ASN1_ENUMERATED_set ,
.Fn BN_to_ASN1_ENUMERATED ,
and
.Fn ASN1_ENUMERATED_to_BN
behave like their
.Vt ASN1_INTEGER
counterparts except that they operate on an
.Vt ASN1_ENUMERATED
object.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn ASN1_INTEGER_get
and
.Fn ASN1_ENUMERATED_get
return the converted value, 0 if
.Fa a
is
.Dv NULL ,
or \-1 on error, which is ambiguous because \-1 is a legitimate
value for an
.Vt ASN1_INTEGER .
.Pp
.Fn ASN1_INTEGER_set
and
.Fn ASN1_ENUMERATED_set
return 1 for success or 0 for failure.
They only fail if a memory allocation error occurs.
.Pp
.Fn BN_to_ASN1_INTEGER
and
.Fn BN_to_ASN1_ENUMERATED
return an
.Vt ASN1_INTEGER
or
.Vt ASN1_ENUMERATED
object, respectively, or
.Dv NULL
if an error occurs.
They only fail due to memory allocation errors.
.Pp
.Fn ASN1_INTEGER_to_BN
and
.Fn ASN1_ENUMERATED_to_BN
return a
.Vt BIGNUM
object of
.Dv NULL
if an error occurs.
They can fail if the passed type is incorrect (due to a programming error)
or due to memory allocation failures.
.Pp
In case of success,
.Fn i2a_ASN1_INTEGER
returns the total number of bytes written, which is at least 2.
It returns 0 if
.Fa a
is
.Dv NULL
or -1 if
.Xr BIO_write 3
fails.

.Xr ASN1_INTEGER_new 3
.Sh HISTORY
.Fn ASN1_INTEGER_set
first appeared in SSLeay 0.5.1.
.Fn ASN1_INTEGER_get ,
.Fn BN_to_ASN1_INTEGER ,
.Fn ASN1_INTEGER_to_BN ,
and
.Fn i2a_ASN1_INTEGER
first appeared in SSLeay 0.6.0.
These functions have been available since
.Ox 2.3 .
.Pp
.Fn ASN1_ENUMERATED_get ,
.Fn ASN1_ENUMERATED_set ,
.Fn BN_to_ASN1_ENUMERATED ,
and
.Fn ASN1_ENUMERATED_to_BN
first appeared in OpenSSL 0.9.2b and have been available since
.Ox 2.6 .
.Sh CAVEATS
In general an
.Vt ASN1_INTEGER
or
.Vt ASN1_ENUMERATED
type can contain an integer of almost arbitrary size
and so cannot always be represented by a C
.Vt long
type.
The ambiguous return values of
.Fn ASN1_INTEGER_get
and
.Fn ASN1_ENUMERATED_get
imply that these functions should be avoided if possible.
