# Generated API and Metadata

This document explains the engine code-generation and metadata-registration flow. Use it when changing generated source, metadata annotations, property definitions, or script-visible API contracts.

## Ownership model

The engine owns the reusable metadata/codegen machinery. An embedding project supplies project configuration, extra metadata sources, common headers, and script/content inputs through CMake options and project files.

Generated files are build artifacts. Document the source annotations, templates, generator inputs, and validation flow; do not treat generated output as hand-authored engine source.

## CMake codegen stage

`BuildTools/cmake/stages/Codegen.cmake` constructs the generator command and output list.

Important command arguments include:

- `-maincfg` — embedding project's main config (`FO_MAIN_CONFIG`).
- `-buildhash` — current build hash.
- `-genoutput` — generated output directory, currently `GeneratedSource` under the CMake binary dir.
- `-devname` / `-nicename` — project identity values.
- `-embedded` — embedded data capacity (`FO_EMBEDDED_DATA_CAPACITY`).
- `-internalcfg` — internal config capacity (`FO_INTERNAL_CONFIG_CAPACITY`).
- `-meta` — metadata source entries from `FO_SOURCE_META_FILES` and managed C# source files tracked through `FO_MANAGED_SOURCE_FILES`. C# script files may also contain script-level `///@` tags such as `Enum`, `Property`, `RefType`, and `Setting`; build-time codegen accepts those tags so `MetadataBaker` can process them during resource baking.
- `-commonheader` — extra common headers from `FO_ADDED_COMMON_HEADERS`.
- `-enginedefine` — repeatable `NAME=VALUE` engine value/shape configuration macro (`FO_GEOMETRY`, `FO_MAP_*`, `FO_EFFECT_*`, `FO_MODEL_*`, `FO_USE_NAMESPACE`, `FO_NO_*`, `FO_MAIN_CONFIG`, ...), resolved to a literal at configure time and emitted into `EngineConfig.gen.h` instead of being passed as a `-D` compiler define. Feature/backend toggles (`FO_ENABLE_3D`, `FO_*_SCRIPTING`) and per-config `FO_DEBUG` stay compiler-side — they gate whole files/headers before any engine header is included.

The stage creates normal and forced code-generation command targets and appends `CodeGeneration` to `FO_GEN_DEPENDENCIES`.

## Generated outputs

`Codegen.cmake` declares generated outputs under `GeneratedSource/`, including:

- `CodeGenTouch`
- `EngineConfig.gen.h` — two-section header: the engine configuration macros (consumed at the top of `Source/Essentials/BasicCore.h`) and the typed build/version constants `FO_BUILD_HASH` / `FO_DEV_NAME` / `FO_NICE_NAME` / `FO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION` / `FO_GIT_BRANCH` (re-included by `Source/Common/Common.h` with `FO_ENGINE_CONFIG_CONSTANTS` defined, after `fo::string_view_nt` exists). Replaces the former `Version-Include.h`.
- `EmbeddedResources.gen.inc`
- `InternalConfig.gen.inc`
- `MetadataRegistration-Server.gen.cpp`
- `MetadataRegistration-Client.gen.cpp`
- `MetadataRegistration-Mapper.gen.cpp`
- `MetadataRegistration-ServerStub.gen.cpp`
- `MetadataRegistration-ClientStub.gen.cpp`
- `MetadataRegistration-MapperStub.gen.cpp`
- `GenericCode-Common.gen.cpp`

These file names are useful for understanding build flow, but changes should usually be made in templates, annotations, metadata sources, or generator scripts rather than in generated output.

## Metadata registration entry points

Hand-authored declarations live in `Source/Common/MetadataRegistration.h`:

- `RegisterServerMetadata()`
- `RegisterClientMetadata()`
- `RegisterMapperMetadata()`
- `RegisterServerStubMetadata()`
- `RegisterClientStubMetadata()`
- `RegisterMapperStubMetadata()`
- `RegisterDynamicMetadata()`
- `ReadMetadataBin()`

`Source/Common/MetadataRegistration.template.cpp` is the template used to generate side-specific registration files. It contains code-generation markers such as `///@ CodeGen RegisterHelpers` and `///@ CodeGen Register`.

`Source/Common/GenericCode.template.cpp` is the template for generated common code.

`GenericCode-Common.cpp` also emits per-target `GetServerSettingsTyped()`, `GetClientSettingsTyped()`, and `GetMapperSettingsTyped()` lists for engine `ExportSettings`. `ManagedScriptBaker` consumes those lists to generate C# `Settings.*` accessors for scalar settings and supported `vector<T>` settings as `List<T>`, while dictionary-shaped settings remain outside this generated managed surface. Mapper generated settings include the Client/Common engine `ExportSettings` surface because mapper AngelScript runs with the same visible engine settings groups for editor rendering and input helpers.

## Engine hook tags

Project/native extension code can mark selected C++ functions with `///@ EngineHook`. `BuildTools/codegen.py` validates hook names and emits no-op stubs for hooks that the embedding project does not implement. Current hook names recognized by the generator are:

- `ApplicationInitHook(AppInitFlags, GlobalSettings&)`
- `ApplicationShutdownHook()`
- `ServerInitHook(ServerEngine*)`
- `ClientInitHook(ClientEngine*)`
- `ClientStartupSettingsHook(GlobalSettings&, int32_t clientIndex, bool embedded)`
- `ConfigSectionParseHook(...)`
- `ConfigEntryParseHook(...)`
- `SetupBakersHook(...)`
- `CheckCritterVisibilityHook(...)`
- `CheckItemVisibilityHook(...)`

`ClientStartupSettingsHook` is called by app entry points immediately before constructing a client engine. Use it for project-owned startup setting adjustments; do not use it as a gameplay authority bypass.

`ApplicationShutdownHook` is a native lifecycle hook for project-owned process integrations that must be stopped before a client runtime DLL is unloaded. It is intentionally not part of the compatibility hash because it does not change script metadata, saved data, or the network contract.

## Dynamic metadata

`Source/Common/MetadataRegistration.cpp` implements `RegisterDynamicMetadata()`. It reads binary metadata sections and dispatches them into typed registration steps such as:

- enums
- entities
- entity holders
- fixed/value/reference types
- properties
- events
- remote calls
- settings
- migration rules

This is the runtime side of metadata that can be loaded from generated/baked data rather than compiled static registration alone.

Migration rules are generic `(kind, extra-info, target → replacement)` remaps with transitive resolution, authored as `///@ MigrationRule <Kind> ...`. Beyond `Proto`/`Property` (applied at proto lookup and property-name resolution), the `Enum` kind is consulted by `PropertiesSerializator` when a persisted enum value **name** no longer resolves on load: the rule remaps the old name to a current value — for scalar enum properties and enum dict keys — instead of throwing `EnumResolveException`. This keeps removed/renamed enum values from bricking old saves.

## Properties and generated contracts

`Source/Common/Properties.h` and `Source/Common/Properties.cpp` define the property runtime model used by entities and metadata. Key concepts include:

- `PropertyRawData`
- `Property`
- `PropertyRegistrator`
- `Properties`
- property getter/setter/post-set callbacks
- base type, struct layout, and serialization-related descriptors

When property metadata changes, inspect both the property runtime and the generator inputs/templates. Script-visible nullability or API changes should also update [Scripting.md](Scripting.md), [ScriptMethodsMap.md](ScriptMethodsMap.md), and [Nullability.md](Nullability.md) as applicable.

When Managed scripting is enabled, `ManagedScriptBaker` consumes the same property metadata to emit typed C# property enums and entity wrappers. The generated base `Entity` includes generic `GetAsInt<TProp>()`, `SetAsInt<TProp>()`, `GetAsAny<TProp>()`, and `SetAsAny<TProp>()` helpers that pass property enum values to native property-index bridges. Each wrapper captures its creating backend's identity and alive flag; native access from a foreign or already-destroyed backend fails with a managed exception before the entity pointer can reach released engine metadata. The generated C# `Game.GetPropertyInfo(<Type>Property, out ...)` overloads are metadata-only mirrors of the AngelScript property-info API for entity and fixed-type properties, so changes to property flags, base type, sync state, or enum names are reflected by a managed rebake. Cross-backend managed callbacks marshal fixed types and entity-proto values as proto-entity handles, matching AngelScript's handle representation while preserving their metadata type identity for function lookup. Scalar AngelScript object handles returned through managed `Game.Invoke<TResult>` stay owned by the call frame until boxing completes, then release the temporary script reference; dynamic ref types are copied into managed values during that window. Generated event surfaces provide synchronous, `Task`-returning, and explicit-`EventResult` handler overloads. A `Task` handler runs synchronously until its first incomplete await; the event chain then continues without blocking the script dispatcher, while the managed bridge observes deferred faults. Explicit `EventResult` handlers remain synchronous. Generated `Game.AddPropertySetter(...)` overloads are also metadata-shaped: entity-only post-set callbacks receive `Action<TEntity>`, simple setters receive `(entity, ref value)`, and property-group setters can receive `(entity, <Type>Property, ref value)` through `PropertySetterWithProperty<TEntity,TProperty,TValue>`.

## Public API relationship

[../PUBLIC_API.md](../PUBLIC_API.md) documents public build/API knobs such as build toggles and project helper functions like resource/package additions. Keep public API docs high-level and stable; put generator internals here.

## Metadata and baker relationship

Metadata generation and metadata baking are related but not identical:

- Codegen produces generated C++/include files used by compiled targets.
- `MetadataBaker` participates in resource baking and can produce metadata data for runtime loading.
- `RegisterDynamicMetadata()` consumes metadata binary data from resources.

For resource baking details, see [BakingPipeline.md](BakingPipeline.md).

## Tests to inspect

Relevant tests include:

- `Source/Tests/Test_EngineMetadata.cpp`
- `Source/Tests/Test_MetadataBaker.cpp`
- `Source/Tests/Test_Properties.cpp`
- Baker/codegen-adjacent tests such as `Test_BakerSetup.cpp` and the specific baker tests when metadata affects baked resources.

If a generated script API change is involved, inspect AngelScript-related tests as well.

## Change routing

- CMake generator arguments/output list: `BuildTools/cmake/stages/Codegen.cmake`.
- Generator script behavior: `BuildTools/codegen.py`.
- Static metadata registration template: `Source/Common/MetadataRegistration.template.cpp`.
- Generated common code template: `Source/Common/GenericCode.template.cpp`.
- Runtime dynamic metadata reader/registrar: `Source/Common/MetadataRegistration.cpp`.
- Property model: `Source/Common/Properties.*` and entity/prototype metadata code.
- Metadata resource baking: `Source/Tools/MetadataBaker.*` and [BakingPipeline.md](BakingPipeline.md).
- Script runtime and script-visible signatures: [Scripting.md](Scripting.md), [ScriptMethodsMap.md](ScriptMethodsMap.md), and [Nullability.md](Nullability.md).

## Validation checklist

1. Configure from an embedding project root so project metadata sources are available.
2. Run normal code generation and verify generated files are updated as expected.
3. Run forced code generation when generator caching/dependency behavior changes.
4. Build the smallest target that compiles the generated files.
5. Run metadata/property tests relevant to the change.
6. If metadata is baked, run the relevant baker test and bake target.
7. Update docs that expose changed public contracts, especially [Scripting.md](Scripting.md), [ScriptMethodsMap.md](ScriptMethodsMap.md), [Nullability.md](Nullability.md), and [../PUBLIC_API.md](../PUBLIC_API.md) when applicable.
